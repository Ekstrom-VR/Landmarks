PRACTICE SESSION

You will be asked to find different stores in the city. 
The name of the target store will appear in the upper left hand corner of the screen.
Find the target store, run into it and wait for the next target to appear.

Don't worry if it takes a little while to learn the city!    
Finding the correct stores will be difficult at first, 
but it will get easier when you become more familiar with the city.  

Please tell the investigator when you have finished reading.
